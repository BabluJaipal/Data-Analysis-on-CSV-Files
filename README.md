# Sales Data Analysis

This project contains an analysis of sales performance using sample sales data. 
The main objective is to study revenue trends over time, across products, and across regions.

## Project Structure

- **Sales_Analysis_Template.ipynb** : Jupyter notebook with all the analysis and visualizations.
- **sales_sample_data.csv** : Raw sales data used for the analysis.
- **monthly_revenue.csv** : Preprocessed monthly revenue data.
- **by_product.csv** : Revenue grouped by product.
- **by_region.csv** : Revenue grouped by region.
- **monthly_revenue.png** : Chart showing monthly revenue trend.
- **revenue_by_product.png** : Chart showing revenue contribution by different products.
- **revenue_by_region.png** : Chart showing revenue by different regions.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install them with:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Make sure the CSV files are in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Sales_Analysis_Template.ipynb
```

4. Run the cells step by step to see the analysis and plots.

## Results

- Monthly revenue trends are plotted to understand growth/decline.
- Revenue breakdown by product helps identify top-performing products.
- Revenue by region shows how different regions contribute to total sales.

The generated plots (`.png` files) are also included in the project folder for quick reference.
